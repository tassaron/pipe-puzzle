# Muffin Game Template
A template for an HTML5/WebGL game using the [Muffin Game Engine](https://github.com/tassaron/muffin-game) and [PixiJS](https://pixijs.io). This repo has some code for an example project to act as a starting point.

**This repo is a template for new projects using JavaScript and NPM.** The engine itself is written in TypeScript but the NPM package currently only works with JavaScript.

## [Click to play the Example Project](https://rainey.tech/static/muffin-game/)

## How to Develop
1. `npm i` this package
1. Edit `src/setup.js` to put some initialization
1. Create Scene classes for the "levels" of your game (scenes can be nested as well)
1. `npm run dev` to build
